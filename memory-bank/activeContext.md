# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Status

The project has achieved significant progress with most core features implemented:

- Frontend scaffolding is complete
- Authentication flow is fully implemented with separated signup/login pages
- Quiz creation form is functional
- Queue-based processing infrastructure is in place
- **Quiz taking flow is fully implemented** (NEW)
- **Quiz results display with SNS sharing** (NEW)
- **Hot/Recent quiz discovery pages** (NEW)
- **User quiz history tracking** (NEW)
- **Bookmark/Favorite functionality** (NEW)
- **Shared quiz display components** (NEW)
- Dynamic navigation with all quiz-related features
- **Primary remaining gap**: LLM integration for quiz generation

### Active Task Area

The main TODO identified in the codebase is the LLM integration in the dequeue function:

```javascript
// TODO dataの内容からLLMにリクエストを行いresponseを取得する
```

Currently, the `dequeue-quiz-requests` function uses hardcoded mock data to demonstrate the flow. All other user-facing features are complete and ready for LLM integration.

## Recent Changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **LLM Integration** (PRIMARY REMAINING TASK)

   - Select LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
   - Design prompt template for quiz generation
   - Implement API call in dequeue function
   - Parse and validate LLM responses
   - Handle errors and edge cases

2. **User Dashboard Completion**

   - My quizzes listing (`/mypage/quizzes`)
   - Quiz status tracking (pending/ready)
   - Edit/delete functionality
   - Dashboard overview page (`/mypage`)

3. **Additional Features**
   - Search/filter functionality for quizzes
   - Pagination for quiz lists
   - Quiz categories/tags
   - User profiles and stats

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### LLM Integration Design

**Decision Needed**: Which LLM provider to use?

- Considerations:
  - Cost per quiz generation
  - Response quality for personality quizzes
  - Japanese language support
  - API reliability and rate limits
  - Response time

**Prompt Engineering**:

- Must generate questions that differentiate between user-defined types
- Need consistent scoring weights (-3 to +3)
- Should create nuanced, thoughtful questions
- Output must be structured (JSON) for parsing

### Data Consistency

**Pattern Observed**: The mock data in dequeue function shows expected structure:

```javascript
{
  quizzes: { title, description, scale_type, theme, created_by },
  quiz_elements: [{ question_text, type_weights: {} }],
  quiz_results: [{ base_type, modifier, description, strengths, etc. }]
}
```

This structure should be maintained when implementing LLM integration.

### Error Handling

**Current Gap**: Limited error handling in queue processing

- What if LLM call fails?
- How to handle malformed responses?
- Should failed requests be retried?
- How to notify users of failures?

### Authentication Flow

**Improved Pattern**:

- Separate pages for login (`/login`) and signup (`/signup`)
- Both use server actions for auth operations
- Logout functionality implemented as server action
- Navigation dynamically shows login/logout based on auth state
- Quiz creation uses client-side function
- Layout is async server component that checks auth state

### Bookmark/Favorite Pattern

**Implementation Design**:

- Server actions for all database operations
- Client component for UI interactions
- Optimistic updates with useTransition
- Revalidates paths after bookmark changes
- Uses existing `bookmarks` table (quiz_id, user_id, created_at)
- All Supabase operations use JavaScript API (no raw SQL)

### Component Reusability Pattern

**QuizCard Component**:

- Server component that can be used anywhere
- Accepts flexible props for different contexts
- Automatically fetches bookmark status
- Supports custom additional info (rank, dates, counts)
- Maintains consistent UI across all quiz lists

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Observations

1. **Client vs Server Components**

   - Quiz creation page is client component ("use client")
   - Login uses server actions
   - Choose based on interactivity needs

2. **Form Handling**

   - FormData API used consistently
   - Server actions for auth
   - Client functions for Supabase Edge Function calls

3. **State Management**

   - Local useState for form inputs
   - No global state currently needed
   - Supabase handles auth state globally

4. **Japanese-First**

   - All UI text in Japanese
   - Variable names in English
   - Comments can be English or Japanese

5. **DaisyUI Components**
   - Heavy use of DaisyUI classes
   - Drawer navigation pattern
   - Consistent button styling with `btn` variants

### Database Patterns

1. **IDs**: Implicit use of Supabase auto-generated IDs
2. **Timestamps**: Likely using Supabase automatic timestamps
3. **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships defined
4. **RLS**: Policies needed for security (not visible in current code)

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Queue-Based Design Success

The decision to use PGMQ for quiz generation is sound:

- Prevents HTTP timeout issues
- Enables async LLM processing
- Scales well with demand
- User gets immediate feedback

### Mock Data Strategy

The hardcoded response in dequeue function is valuable:

- Demonstrates expected data structure
- Can be used for testing UI
- Provides template for LLM prompt design
- Shows example of quality output

### Database Schema Design

The separation of quiz_elements and quiz_element_score is elegant:

- Allows flexible scoring per result type
- Enables complex personality typing
- Makes score calculation straightforward
- Supports future analytics

### Areas Needing Attention

1. **Loading States**: No visible loading indicators when quiz is being generated
2. **Notifications**: No system to notify users when quiz is ready
3. **Error States**: Limited error handling and user feedback
4. **Validation**: Client-side validation exists, need server-side too
5. **Security**: RLS policies need review/implementation

- Development environment functional
- Can run `npm run dev` in `frontennd/` directory

### Next Session Starting Point

When resuming work, the logical next step is implementing the LLM integration:

1. Choose LLM provider
2. Design prompt template
3. Implement API call
4. Test with real quiz generation
5. Then move to implementing quiz-taking flow

This represents the critical path to a working MVP.
