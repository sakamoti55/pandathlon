## What's Left to Build

### 🔴 Critical (MVP Blockers)

1. **LLM Integration**

   - Current Status: TODO comment in dequeue function
   - Needed:
     - Choose LLM provider
     - Design prompt template
     - Implement API call
     - Parse responses
     - Error handling
   - Impact: Without this, no real quizzes can be generated (ONLY REMAINING BLOCKER)

### 🟡 High Priority (Important Features)

2. **User Quiz Management** (`/mypage/quizzes`, `/mypage/quizzes/[quizId]`)

   - Current Status: Unimplemented
   - Needed:
     - List user's created quizzes (`/mypage/quizzes`)
     - Show quiz status (pending/ready/published)
     - Quiz detail/edit page (`/mypage/quizzes/[quizId]`)
     - Edit quiz metadata
     - Delete quizzes
     - View quiz statistics
   - Impact: User management and control

3. **Improved Quiz Management**
   - Quiz editing functionality
   - Quiz deletion with confirmation
   - Draft/published status toggling
   - Quiz performance analytics

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Enhancements)

4. **Loading & Status Indicators**

   - Quiz generation in progress
   - Loading states during navigation
   - Success/error notifications

5. **Error Handling**

   - Form validation errors
   - API call failures
   - Network issues
   - User-friendly error messages

6. **Database Security**

   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Proper access controls
   - Data validation

7. **User Feedback System**
   - Toast notifications
   - Success messages
   - Loading spinners

### 🔵 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

   - Popular results

9. **Social Features**

   - Quiz comments/reviews
   - User profiles
   - Follow/follower system

10. **Advanced Quiz Features**
    - Quiz categories/tags
    - Quiz images
    - Multiple quiz formats
    - Timed quizzes

## Current Status

### Project Phase

**Mid Development** - Core infrastructure complete, most user-facing features implemented

### Completion Estimate

- Infrastructure: 90%
- Core Features: 70%
- User Experience: 75%
- Testing: 5%
- Production Readiness: 35%

### Active Development Areas

1. Planning LLM integration strategy (PRIMARY FOCUS)
2. User dashboard implementation
3. Production readiness improvements

### Blocked/Waiting

- LLM provider selection decision needed
- Environment variables configuration (may need verification)
- Database RLS policy definition

## Known Issues

### 🐛 Bugs

None identified yet (limited testing so far)

### ⚠️ Technical Debt

1. **Form Handling Patterns**

   - Auth uses server actions (login, signup, logout)
   - Quiz creation uses client-side function
   - Both patterns work, standardization not critical

2. **Missing TypeScript**

   - Project uses JavaScript
   - Type safety would prevent errors
   - Migration could be beneficial

3. **Limited Error Handling**

   - Few try-catch blocks
   - No error boundary components
   - Silent failures possible

4. **No Testing**
   - No unit tests
   - No integration tests
   - No E2E tests

### 🔒 Security Concerns

1. **RLS Policies** - Not visible in current code, may not be configured
2. **Input Validation** - Server-side validation needed
3. **Rate Limiting** - Edge Functions may need limits
4. **CORS** - Currently allows all origins (`*`)

### 📊 Performance Considerations

1. **No Caching** - Every request hits database
2. **No Pagination** - Could be slow with many quizzes
3. **No Image Optimization** - If images are added later
4. **Bundle Size** - Not yet optimized

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision: Queue-Based Processing**

- When: Initial architecture
- Why: LLM calls take time, prevent timeouts
- Status: Implemented and working
- Impact: Enables reliable async processing

**Decision: Supabase as Backend**

- When: Project start
- Why: All-in-one solution (DB, Auth, Functions)
- Status: Fully integrated
- Impact: Faster development, less infrastructure management

**Decision: Next.js App Router**

- When: Project start
- Why: Modern React patterns, server components
- Status: Implemented throughout
- Impact: Better performance, SEO-ready

### Technology Decisions

**Decision: React 19 + Next.js 16**

- When: Project start
- Why: Latest features, future-proof
- Status: Working well
- Impact: Access to newest React features

**Decision: Tailwind + DaisyUI**

- When: Project start
- Why: Rapid UI development, consistency
- Status: Used extensively
- Impact: Fast UI iteration, consistent design

**Decision: JavaScript (not TypeScript)**

- When: Project start
- Why: Faster initial development
- Status: Current implementation
- Impact: Less boilerplate, but less type safety
- Future: May migrate to TypeScript

### Data Model Decisions

**Decision: Separate quiz_element_score Table**

- When: Database schema design
- Why: Flexible scoring per result type
- Status: Implemented
- Impact: Enables complex personality typing

**Decision: PGMQ for Message Queue**

- When: Early development
- Why: PostgreSQL-native, simpler than external queue
- Status: Working
- Impact: One less external dependency

### Feature Decisions

**Decision: 7-Point Scale for Questions**

- When: Design phase
- Why: More nuanced than yes/no or 5-point
- Status: Defined in schema
- Impact: Better personality differentiation

**Decision: Dynamic Result Types**

- When: Quiz creation design
- Why: User flexibility, not limited to preset types
- Status: Implemented in form
- Impact: Unlimited quiz variety

**Decision: Mock Data in Dequeue**

- When: Initial implementation
- Why: Demonstrate flow before LLM integration
- Status: Currently active
- Impact: Can test UI before LLM ready
